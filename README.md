  1. How do I approach designing software?
     -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
     Working on this project, I've been able to understand how OpenGL works, as well as how to build a 3D scene and add textures to it.
     -What design process did you follow for your project work?
     The general design process I followed was simple, as I designed my project around what I found in my room: my bed, a window, a table, and my plushie. 
     -How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
     The tactics I used can be applied to future work by helping me keep my designs simple and down to earth, and not too complex.
   3. How do I approach developing programs?
      -What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      One new strategy I used while working on my scene is by brainstorming through looking at random pictures of simple scenes. This helped me figure out which scene I wanted to pick and work on in the end.
      -How did iteration factor into your development?
      Slow and constant iterations, implementing small changes through the term towards my scene helped me pace myself and prevented me from becoming overwhelmed.
      -How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      Throughout the different milestones, I've become better at researching on how to implement certain features properly. This has also helped me with becoming more efficient in writing my code, too.
  5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
     -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
     This class gives me more confidence and skills- particularly skills on OpenGL and c++ as a whole- which can be applied towards my future educational pathway by helping me utilize different ways to showcase my ideas in future potential coding projects.
     -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
     For my future professional pathway, I believe that computational graphics and viz. is incredibly useful when becoming a software engineer, as it gives me some sort of foundation in OpenGL- which is widely used.
